### What I did?

- Downloaded the project.
- Analysed the project; looked through it to see how it was coded, I looked at what it contains.
- Read the requirements in order to make a view to integrate the changes into the existing solution.
- Used variables for each color code to each component separately.
- Added the items from the layers.
- Then, to make components visible/invisible from the map when the user clicks on an element, I used the toggle function of jQuery. Having the jQuery library, I chose to go this way (I could have used simple JavaScript).
- I thought I'd add a button bottom right so that the user could click on it to change the map in night mode (being two versions available: day mode/night mode).
- Compiled the SCSS to CSS.


### Setup

> In order to make any change to the source code, you have to compile the SCSS again (with "node-sass" package). The steps to start the watcher (that compiles the SCSS) are:
- npm install
- npm run watch:scss
- enjoy changing the code
